The project illustrates a concept of derivative structures random sampling method.
The concept is based on spinel example MgAl_{1.0}$Fe_{1.0}O_4. The system has totally
12870 structures, but only 97 symmetry-equivalent ones (SIC). The presented algorithm
randomly obtains structures with their symmetries and after proceeses it, with two options
1) Random sampling without symmetry considerations (simple algorithm).
2) Random sampling with symmetry consideration (SES algorithm).

Files:
  rs_spinel.tar.gz - archive with structures and number of symmetries operations for 
                     each structure.
  rs_simul.bash    - RS algorithm implementation.
  rs_stat.bash     - RS algorithm verification program. The program compare probability to
                     obtain structures with different symmetry for simple random sampling and
                     RS-SES algorithm.
